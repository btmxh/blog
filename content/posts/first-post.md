So I guess I'll post stuff that I'm interetested in here.

Hi, I guess.

Also I probably won't post much because I seldom do anything that interesting.
(I wish I could work on things that fascinated me, but idk the economy is kind of
in a bad state right now.)

Here is some test LaTeX (inline and block): \( L_o(\mathbf{x}, \omega_o, \lambda, t) = L_e(\mathbf{x}, \omega_o, \lambda, t) + L_r(\textbf{x}, \omega_o, \lambda, t) \),

\[ L_r(\textbf{x}, \omega_o, \lambda, t) = \int_\Omega f_r (\textbf{x}, \omega_o, \lambda, t) L_i (\textbf{x}, \omega_o, \lambda, t) (\omega_i \cdot \mathbf{n}) d \omega_i. \]
